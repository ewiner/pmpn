# pmpn

_useful typosafe bindings for the average Typoscript programmer_

I cannot for the life of me spell `pnpm` right the first time.  I know it's spelled `pnpm` but my muscle memory is stuck typing it backwards.  This is the bane of my existence:

```
zsh: command not found: pmpn
```

So, inspired by [gti](https://github.com/rwos/gti), which is in turn inspired by [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl), here's `pmpn`, a little program that shows you a little animated low rider then runs your intended package manager. 

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add -g pmpn
```

## Usage

```bash
$ pmpn [command] [flags]
```
and enjoy the show.
